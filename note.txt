What is Node.js?
-JavaScript runtime(Not a language and framework)
-Built on the V8 JavaScript engine(same as google chrome)
-written C++
-Esentially allows us to run JavaScript code on the server

Why use Node?
-fast,efficient and highly sclabale
-event driven,non-blocking I/O model
-popular in the industry
-same language on the front and back end(JS)

Non-Blocking I/O
-works on a single thread using non-blocking I/O calls
-supports tens of thousands concurrent connections
-optimizes throughput &scalability in apps with many I/O operations
-All of this makes Node.js very fast and efficient

Node Event Loop
-single threaded
-supports concurrency via events and callbacks
-EventEmitter class is used to binds events and listeners

Best types of projects for node
-Rest API and microservices
-Real time services(chat,live updates)
-crud apps-(blogs,shooping cart,social networks)
-toos and utilities

NPM node package manager
-install 3rd party package(frameworks,libraries,tools,etc)
-packages get stored in the "node_modules" folder
-all dependencies are listed in a "package.js" file 
-NPM scripts can be created to run certain tasks such as run as server

npm init ==>genereate a package.js file 
npm install express==>install a package locally
npm install -d nodemon ==>install a package globally

Node Modules
-Node core Modules(path,fs,os,http,etc)
-3rd party modules/packages installed via NPM
-custom modules(files)

const path=require('os');
